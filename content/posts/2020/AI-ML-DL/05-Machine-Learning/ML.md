Machine learning is basically making software that is able to learn how to do a task without us telling it how to do it.
It's different from normal software that only executes tasks a developer specified through code.
With machine learning, we can make software that learns how to write on its own.
It could then write totally new sentences, paragraphs, or even entire books, all on its own.

The simple version of machine learning is this: we give a machine a lot of data regarding a topic. Let's say images of cats.
After showing it hundreds, or even thousands of cats, we then give it a test. For example, asking it to name the animal in this picture.
